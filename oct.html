            <p class="snp">So im waiting for Adan to describe this and I would tet him but there is no service down here for some reason so im just gonna keep writing until it seems like enough to describe the night but I am not sure how long thats gonna take or how much it would hypothtically take up. That was a very long run on sentence. Anyways im currently listening to Omar Apollos new album Ivory. I like the current song, Tamagotchi.</p>
